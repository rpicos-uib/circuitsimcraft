# CircuitSimCraft: Electronics Engineer's Workshop
#
# Builds a small, self-contained lab with a Workbench job site inside, ready for a nearby
# unemployed villager to claim as an Electronics Engineer. Run with:
#
#   /function circuitsimcraft:engineer_workshop
#
# Stand on the spot you want as the workshop's floor center before running it - the whole
# structure is placed relative to that position (floor one block below your feet, walls rising
# around you). Builds its own solid foundation first, so it's safe to run over uneven terrain,
# water, or ungenerated chunks alike. Deliberately a different material palette from the
# Electrician's Workshop (stone brick/andesite/iron "lab" look instead of oak/copper "cabin"
# look) so the two are visually distinct at a glance, not just functionally.

# Clear the build volume first so trees/terrain can't poke through the walls or roof.
fill ~-5 ~-3 ~-5 ~5 ~6 ~5 minecraft:air

# Solid footing, two blocks thick, regardless of what's underneath. Matches the clear
# volume's full x/z extent (not just the walls' footprint) so the outer ring cleared above
# doesn't get left as an open-air trench with nothing under it.
fill ~-5 ~-3 ~-5 ~5 ~-2 ~5 minecraft:stone

# Floor. Matches the footing's full x/z extent (not just the walls' footprint), same reasoning
# as the footing's own comment above - otherwise the ring between the walls and the footing's
# edge is left as an empty, un-filled gap right at walking level, most noticeable right outside
# the door.
