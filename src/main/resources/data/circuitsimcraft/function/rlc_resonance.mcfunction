# CircuitSimCraft: Experiment 3 - RLC Resonance Bode Plot
#
# The same idea as the RC low-pass bench, but with an inductor inserted between the resistor
# and capacitor, turning a first-order rolloff into a second-order response capable of
# resonant peaking. See latex_mod/sections/07_results_experiments.tex for the full writeup.
# Run with:
#
#   /function circuitsimcraft:rlc_resonance
#
# Stand where you want the bench's southwest corner before running it. Clears its own space
# and pours its own foundation first.
#
# Right-click the resistor three times, cycling 100 -> 1000 -> 10,000 -> 10 ohm (the fourth
# and smallest preset, reached by wrapping back around past the top of the cycle). Right-click
# the inductor twice (0.1 -> 1 -> 5H) and the capacitor twice (10 -> 100 -> 1000uF) - both to
# their largest preset. Shift-right-click the AC Source and set its frequency range to
# 0.2Hz-20Hz. Flip the lever, right-click the given AC probe against the AC Source to pin it,
# then right-click the capacitor to run the sweep. Expected: a resonant peak around 2.24Hz at
# roughly +17.0dB above the passband, then a fall-off at the second-order asymptotic rate of
# -40dB/decade, ~-38dB below the peak by the sweep's 20Hz upper bound.
