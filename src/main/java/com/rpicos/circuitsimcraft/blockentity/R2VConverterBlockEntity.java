/** Stamps V = redstoneA*16 + redstoneB as a plain DC voltage source between its up lead (node A)
 *  and its down lead (node B, always the real 0V reference - see
 *  {@link com.rpicos.circuitsimcraft.block.GroundedComponentBlock}). {@code redstoneA}/{@code
 *  redstoneB} are pushed in by {@link com.rpicos.circuitsimcraft.block.R2VConverterBlock#neighborChanged}
 *  whenever a redstone neighbor changes, not read live during a circuit rebuild - a rebuild can
 *  happen for reasons unrelated to redstone (e.g. a neighboring component's own value changing),
 *  so the last-known signal strengths need to already be cached here. Deliberately does *not*
 *  read its neighbors' redstone state from {@code setLevel} on attach (unlike a first instinct
 *  might suggest, to avoid a freshly-placed block starting at a stale 0/0 reading) - querying
 *  neighboring block state that early, while this chunk's neighbors may still be mid-load, is a
 *  known way to trigger expensive/cascading chunk-loading from inside block-entity attachment.
 *  {@link com.rpicos.circuitsimcraft.block.PowerSupplyBlock} already gets away with the same
 *  neighborChanged-only approach for its own redstone gating, so this mirrors a proven pattern
 *  rather than reaching for extra startup-time correctness that isn't actually free. */
