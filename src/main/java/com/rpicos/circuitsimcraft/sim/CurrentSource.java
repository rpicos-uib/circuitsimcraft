/** An ideal independent current source: unlike {@link VoltageSource}, this needs no branch-
 *  current unknown at all - a fixed (or time-varying) current is simply injected straight into
 *  the RHS vector at its two nodes, exactly like {@link Diode}'s own equivalent-current term,
 *  just without an accompanying conductance since a current source has none. Deliberately not
 *  an {@code AcStampable}: an independent source silenced for a small-signal sweep should
 *  become an *open* circuit (zero current, infinite impedance), which is exactly what omitting
 *  an AC stamp already achieves for free - unlike an independent voltage source, whose silenced
 *  AC equivalent is a short (see {@code AcVoltageSource.zero}), not an open. */
