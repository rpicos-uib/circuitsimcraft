/** Simplest square-law MOSFET model, saturation region only (no triode/ohmic region, no
 *  channel-length modulation): drain current magnitude {@code Id = k * (Vov)^2} where
 *  {@code Vov = polarity*(Vgate-Vsource) - thresholdVolts} is the overdrive voltage, 0
 *  (cutoff) when {@code Vov <= 0}. The gate draws no DC current at all (an ideal, infinite
 *  gate impedance) - it only ever appears as the controlling voltage of a transconductance
 *  term, never as a current path, matching a real MOSFET's insulated gate. Linearized each
 *  tick about the previous tick's Vgs into a companion transconductance-plus-equivalent-
 *  current pair, the same spirit {@link Diode} already uses for its own nonlinear I-V
 *  relation - not a full Newton-Raphson iteration within a single tick.
 *
 *  <p>{@code polarity} is {@code +1} for an NMOS - conducts (current flows drain to source)
 *  when {@code Vgs} exceeds a positive threshold - or {@code -1} for a PMOS - conducts
 *  (current flows source to drain) when {@code Vgs} falls more than a threshold *below* zero.
 *  Deliberately takes {@code thresholdVolts} as a plain positive magnitude for both polarities
 *  (folding the sign difference entirely into {@code polarity} instead), so the value editor
 *  never asks a player to remember "PMOS thresholds are negative" - one of this model's
 *  simplifications, not a physical claim that real depletion-mode devices work this way. */
