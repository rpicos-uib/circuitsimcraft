/** Simplest large-signal BJT model: the base-emitter junction is an ordinary diode (reusing
 *  {@link DiodeMath}'s exact companion linearization), and the collector current is a fixed
 *  multiple ({@code beta}) of whatever base current that junction is conducting - the classic
 *  intro-course "current-gain" picture, deliberately not a full Ebers-Moll model (no separate
 *  saturation/cutoff regions beyond the base-emitter junction itself simply not conducting
 *  below its turn-on voltage, no early effect, no base-width modulation). {@code beta} is the
 *  one editable parameter, matching the "simplest model, one knob" brief this component family
 *  was built to.
 *
 *  <p>{@code polarity} is {@code +1} for an NPN (base-emitter junction conducts base-to-emitter
 *  like a normal diode when forward biased; collector current flows collector-to-emitter) or
 *  {@code -1} for a PNP (junction conducts emitter-to-base instead; collector current flows
 *  emitter-to-collector) - the two device types are the exact same equations mirrored, the same
 *  pattern {@link Mosfet} uses for NMOS/PMOS. */
