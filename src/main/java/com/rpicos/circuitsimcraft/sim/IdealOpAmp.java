/** An ideal operational amplifier: infinite open-loop gain, infinite input impedance (no

 *  "nullor" way in MNA - not as a resistive element, but as its own branch-current unknown,
 *  the same mechanism {@link VoltageSource} uses, except the constraint equation
 *  ({@code v_plus == v_minus}, the "virtual short" every negative-feedback op-amp circuit
 *  relies on) references different nodes than the ones the branch current is injected into
 *  ({@code out}). That asymmetry is why this isn't just a VoltageSource with value 0. */
